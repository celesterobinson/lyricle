# Lyricle

Celeste Robinson

## Objective

Build a React/Redux App integrated with the MusixMatch API that displays lyrics based on user input. Allow user to favorite songs they love so they can quickly access the lyrics of those songs. Make the app completely responsive.

Unfortunately, full use of this API is very expensive. Users will only be able to see 30% of the lyrics. My long-term goal is to purchase full use.
