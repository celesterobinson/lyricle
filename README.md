# Lyricle

Celeste Robinson

## Objective

Build an React/Redux App integrated with the MusixMatch API that displays lyrics to the user based on the track and artist that they input. Allow user to favorite songs they love so they can quickly access the lyrics of those songs. Make the app completely responsive.

Unfortunately, full use of this API is very expensive. Users will only be able to see 30% of the lyrics. Ultimate goal is to purchase full use.
